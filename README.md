# cafo-clustering
This repo contains a code example from my work with Stanford Reglab on concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). I wrote the `cluster.py` script to cluster polygon outputs from an image segmentation model with open-source land parcel data in order to predict and size CAFO facilities. The algorithm leverages a graph data structure for fast, scalable processing of complex spatial relationships.
